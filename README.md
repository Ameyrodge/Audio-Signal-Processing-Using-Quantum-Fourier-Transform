# Introduction
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) plays a crucial role in Quantum Computing, serving as a fundamental building block for various quantum algorithms that achieve exponential speedups over their classical counterparts. The rise of quantum computing has introduced transformative prospects for signal processing, with the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) emerging as a potent tool for efficiently dissecting and extracting information from signals. This project delves into the domain of audio signal processing, harnessing the capabilities of QFT for an exploration of frequency components within musical notes. Motivated by the inherent advantages of QFT over its classical counterpart, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), this study illuminates the efficiency gains achieved through the logarithmic resource requirements of QFT compared to the linear resource demands of DFT. This distinction becomes particularly crucial for problems involving a multitude of frequencies, where quantum algorithms showcase remarkable speedups. The study unfolds within the framework of Qiskit, IBM's software development kit for quantum computing. Through a theoretical exploration of QFT, the aim is to understand its foundations and practical implications in the realm of audio analysis, particularly in the detection of musical notes.
