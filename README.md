# Introduction
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) plays a crucial role in Quantum Computing, serving as a fundamental building block for various quantum algorithms that achieve exponential speedups over their classical counterparts. The rise of quantum computing has introduced transformative prospects for signal processing, with the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) emerging as a potent tool for efficiently dissecting and extracting information from signals. This project delves into the domain of audio signal processing, harnessing the capabilities of QFT for an exploration of frequency components within musical notes. Motivated by the inherent advantages of QFT over its classical counterpart, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), this study illuminates the efficiency gains achieved through the logarithmic resource requirements of QFT compared to the linear resource demands of DFT. This distinction becomes particularly crucial for problems involving a multitude of frequencies, where quantum algorithms showcase remarkable speedups. The study unfolds within the framework of Qiskit, IBM's software development kit for quantum computing. Through a theoretical exploration of QFT, the aim is to understand its foundations and practical implications in the realm of audio analysis, particularly in the detection of musical notes.

The `numpy` package is used for numerical computations, such as generating audio signals and calculating the frequencies of musical notes. The `qiskit` package is the main quantum computing framework that is used in the code. It provides a high-level API for creating, compiling, and executing quantum circuits. The `Aer` module in `qiskit` provides a simulator for quantum computers that can be used to simulate the execution of quantum circuits on a classical computer. The `transpile` function from the `qiskit.compiler` module can be used to optimize quantum circuits for execution on real quantum computers. The `plot_histogram` function from the `qiskit.visualization` module can be used to visualize the results of quantum computations, such as the distribution of measurement outcomes.

These packages are essential for implementing the QFT-based algorithm for detecting musical notes in audio signals. They provide the necessary tools for representing audio signals as quantum circuits, implementing the QFT, measuring the transformed signals, and analyzing the measurement outcomes.
